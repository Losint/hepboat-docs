## Quick Start Guide
Hey there, thanks for checking out HepBoat.

This site will show you the ropes on how to get started with HepBoat, and this page will serve as a central check-in to direct you to certain parts of this site depending on how comfortable you are with Rowboat (HepBoat). 

Below are certain "experience levels" and will show you which page to start at to learn the ropes of the bot.

###I Don't Have The Bot Yet, And I Have No Idea What I'm Doing!

No problem! You should probably just click the button at the bottom of this page that will bring you to the next page, and keep reading and repeating, it will give you the rundown on how to get the bot, and show you how to use it! It will also provide all the resources to keep learning once you've mastered the content on this site.

###I Have The Bot! But What Do I Do Now?!?!

Thanks for adding the bot! Now you're probably going to want to start with the [What is HepBoat](src.md) page, and scroll down a bit to the sample config, this will show you the basics on how to start using the configuration tool in the dashboard (as well as how to even *get* to the dashboard!).

###Ive Worked With YAML Before And Know How To Configure!

Perfect! Then you can probably fast forward to the [General Configuration](general.md) and continue from there, this will show you how to start enabling features of the bot and get it working in your server! Once you're done, you can now skip to the finer controls and enabling other plugins, you can view the [plugins here.](plugins/README.md)

###I've Used Rowboat Before And Know What I'm Doing.

In that case, you're free to cruise through the docs at your own speed. Learn how to add the bot and access the dashboard [here](setup.md).

###I'm Staff On A Server With Your Bot!

No worries, you can see a list of all staff commands [here](moderator.md), and if your server admins/ owner have granted you dashboard access, you can login [here](https://mod.imjake.me)
