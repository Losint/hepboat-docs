## Quick Start Guide
Hey there, thanks for checking out HepBoat.

This site will show you the ropes on how to get started with HepBoat, and this page will serve as a central check-in to
direct you to certain parts of this site depending on how comfortable you are with Rowboat (HepBoat). 

Below are certain "experience levels" and will show you which page to start at to learn the ropes of the bot.

### I don't have the bot yet!

No problem! Check out [What is Hepboat](src.md) for basic details on what the bot can do and the 
[Setting Up HepBoat](setup.md) page for details on server criteria.

In order to start using the bot, you will need to first submit a whitelist application for your Discord server. 
You may do this [in this Google form](https://teamhydra.dev/hepboat-whitelist/). You will be contacted after applying 
with more information and the results of the application. 
 
If your server has not been whitelisted and you try to invite the bot, it will automatically leave your server.

### I've been whitelisted; what do I do now?

If your whitelist application has been accepted, you can invite the bot to your discord server and get it set up. 
You can find the `Invite Bot` link at the top of this page or click [here](http://u.imjake.me/hepboat). More 
information on how to set up the bot can be found in [Setting Up HepBoat](setup.md).

### I have the bot; how do I set it up?

Thanks for adding the bot! You will want to start with the [Setting Up HepBoat](setup.md) page, and check out the sample 
config at the bottom of the page. This will show you the basics on how to start using the configuration tool in the 
dashboard. You can also reach the dashboard at https://mod.imjake.me/ or with the `Bot Dashboard` link at the very 
top of the page.

### I've worked with YAML before and know what to do!

Perfect! Then you can probably fast forward to the [General Configuration](general.md) and continue from there. This 
will show you how to start enabling features of the bot and get it working in your server! Once you're done, you can 
now skip to the finer controls and enabling other plugins. You can view the
[plugins documentation here.](plugins/README.md)

### I've used rowboat before and know what I'm doing!

In that case, you're free to cruise through the docs at your own speed. Learn how to add the bot and access the
dashboard with the [Setting Up HepBoat](setup.md) guide.

### I'm staff on a server with your bot.

No worries, you can see an overview list of all staff commands at [Moderator Command Quick-Reference](moderator.md), 
and if your server admins/owner have granted you dashboard access, you can login at https://mod.teamhydra.dev/ to 
view or edit your server configuration.
